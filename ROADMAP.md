# ErpNet.FP — Roadmap to v1.0

> Last updated: 2026-05-07 (evening) · Current version: **0.2.17**

A pure-Python drop-in replacement for the C# ErpNet.FP fiscal-printer
HTTP server, oriented at the Bulgarian POS / retail market. Adds
native Odoo IoT Box compatibility, customer-display drivers, scale
drivers, packaging-weight QC, and a sister daemon (`hid2serial`) that
turns USB / BLE HID barcode scanners into virtual serial ports for
clean integration.

---

## Where we are (v0.2.5)

### Hardware drivers
- ✅ **Datecs PM** (FP-700 MX series)
- ✅ **Datecs ISL** (DP-25, DP-150, DP-150X, FP-700X, FP-2000, etc.)
- ✅ **Customer displays**: Datecs DPD-201 + ESC/POS-compatible clones (ICD CD-5220, Birch DSP-V9, Bematech PDX-3000)
- ✅ **Scales**: CAS PR-II / PD-II + Elicom EVL CASH47 + Datecs CAS-compat (~75% of BG retail), Toledo 8217 industrial, generic ASCII continuous (ACS / JCS / no-name OEM)
- ✅ **HID barcode scanners**: USB HID + serial CDC + BLE — through `hid2serial` v0.1.6 sister daemon (production-ready Linux .deb, 23 MB Windows installer in v0.2.0-dev)
- ✅ **Pinpad**: Datecs Pay (NDA-locked)

### Integration
- ✅ Native Odoo IoT Box compatibility — `/hw_drivers/{action,event}` (Odoo 18) + `/iot_drivers/{action,event}` (Odoo 19+); single instance serves both
- ✅ `l10n_bg_erp_net_fp` v18 module → `iot.box` + `iot.device` + Phase 3 packaging weight QC; LIVE on dev-18 (18.0.10.0.4)
- ✅ Dashboard with version badge + 5 tabbed device sections + reader running indicator + auto-refresh
- ✅ **End-to-end POS test passed** (Teemi TMSL-55 BLE → hid2serial → ErpNet.FP → dev-18 Odoo POS, 2026-05-06)

### Observability (added 2026-05-06 late evening — half of v0.4 done)
- ✅ `/metrics` Prometheus endpoint — request count, per-path latency histogram, per-device error rate, scale reads, last weight gauge, reader/display counters
- ✅ Local monitoring stack — Prometheus + Grafana in `docker-compose.yml`, scrapes proxy every 5 s, 7-day retention, ~220 MB RAM, anonymous Viewer access
- ✅ Pre-loaded dashboard `erpnet-fp-overview` (provisioned via YAML)
- ✅ TLS via Traefik wildcard cert (`grafana.lan.mcpworks.net`, ACME DNS-01 through Cloudflare resolver `cf`)
- ✅ Embedded view inside Odoo — `l10n_bg_erp_net_fp` 18.0.10.1.0 + 19.0.10.1.0: new "Monitoring" menu under ErpNet.FP that opens the dashboard in a kiosk-mode iframe (URL configurable in Settings → POS → Packaging Weight QC → Embedded Grafana monitoring)

### Shipped 2026-05-07 (post-0.2.5)

- ✅ **OHAUS Ranger SICS scale driver** (TCP MT-SICS, Ethernet kit P/N 30037447) — 0.2.10
- ✅ **Datecs PM `read_device_info`** (CMD 0x7B) — populates serial / FM / firmware in `/printers` — 0.2.10
- ✅ **`/admin/self-update` endpoint + UI modal** (docker:25-cli sidecar with `compose --force-recreate`) — 0.2.11..0.2.14
- ✅ **`/printers/{id}/vat-rates`** GET (read) + POST (program) — Datecs PM cmd 0x53; eliminates need for service tech to fix "Forbidden VAT" rejections — 0.2.15
- ✅ **`/admin/logs` + `/admin/logs/stream` SSE** — in-memory ring buffer (5000 lines), level/contains filters, Server-Sent Events for live tail — 0.2.16
- ✅ **Auto-bootstrap admin token** + `/admin/bootstrap-info` (RFC1918-restricted, one-time-claim → 410 Gone) — operators no longer need `ERPNET_ADMIN_TOKEN` env var preconfigured — 0.2.17
- ✅ **l10n_bg_erp_net_fp split** — core (CE-installable) + EE bridge `l10n_bg_erp_net_fp_iot` + OCA bridge `l10n_bg_erp_net_fp_iot_oca`; **v19 deployed today** (was open in roadmap)
- ✅ **Per-cashier operator credentials** on `res.users` — sent to Datecs as operator/password per receipt
- ✅ **Cloudflare bot-rule UA workaround** — browser-like UA on backend HTTP calls (was 403'ing fp.stedy.bg behind CF)

### What's still missing for v1.0

- Hardware coverage gaps: **Borica** / **myPOS** pinpads, **Posiflex PD-2600/2800** displays, **Datecs ETS** / **Elicom EPS** label-printing scales
- Fiscal printers: **Tremol** / **Eltrade** / **Incotex** — stubs exist, need full driver
- ~~l10n_bg_erp_net_fp v19 deploy~~ — **DONE 2026-05-07**
- Persistent device state, webhook delivery retry/DLQ, audit log JSONL rotation
- Quality: minimal test coverage (173 unit tests today, no integration), no CI, no hardware-in-loop testing
- Distribution: no signed Docker images, no Helm chart, no public release announcement
- Windows: code-complete (`hid2serial` v0.2.0-dev) but **awaiting real-hardware test** with com0com + scanner

## Roadmap

### ~~v0.3 — Hardware completeness~~ → split

The original v0.3 was scoped as one milestone. Today's session shipped
**half of it** (HID scanner integration + auto-detect + hot-reload on
disconnect). The remaining half stays as v0.3 below.

### v0.3 — Remaining hardware (~2 weeks, awaiting client hardware)

**Goal:** cover the last 5% of the BG market.

- **Pinpad drivers**: Borica + myPOS terminal (no NDA blocker; spec is public)
- **Customer-display driver**: Posiflex PD-2600 / PD-2800 native protocol
- **Scale drivers**: Datecs ETS / Elicom EPS label-printing (with PLU sync from Odoo product list) — required for butcher / deli clients
- **Fiscal printer drivers**: finish Tremol / Eltrade / Incotex
- l10n_bg_erp_net_fp 19.0.10.0.x — repair `l10n_bg_*` schema gaps on dev-19, deploy
- Discovery wizard: browser-side fetch fallback for LAN-only setups (currently does server-side request, fails when proxy hostname is local-only)

### v0.4 — Production hardening (~2 weeks)

**Goal:** safe to deploy at any client without babysitting.

- HTTPS auth: Bearer / mTLS / IP allow-list, picked per server in config.yaml
- Per-device health monitoring — probe every 30 s, alert on webhook if a device stays down longer than 5 min
- ~~`/metrics` Prometheus endpoint~~ — **DONE in 0.2.5** (full Counter/Gauge/Histogram, bounded label cardinality)
- Persistent device state — JSON cache for last weight, last scan, last receipt; survives restart
- Webhook delivery with retry queue + dead-letter queue
- Audit log for all outgoing fiscal commands — JSONL, rotate daily, optional remote shipment
- Windows hardware test with `hid2serial` 0.2.0 → release as 0.2.0 stable

### v0.4.5 — Fleet remote management (DESIGN APPROVED 2026-05-07, ~1 week)

**Goal:** one Odoo backend (dev-18) controls every deployed ErpNet.FP
proxy without per-instance SSH.

**Architecture:**
```
ErpNet.FP startup + every 60 s:
   POST <registry_url>/erp_net_fp/registry/heartbeat
   X-Registry-Secret: <per-proxy-secret>
   {host, version, admin_token, devices}

Odoo upserts erpnet.fp.proxy record.
```

**Phase 1 — Heartbeat protocol:**
- Proxy `config.yaml` adds `server.registry: {url, secret}`; httpx-async task every 60 s; pushes admin_token (so Odoo back-channel `/admin/*` works)
- Odoo `/erp_net_fp/registry/heartbeat` controller (validates per-proxy secret); upserts `erpnet.fp.proxy(name, url, version, admin_token, last_seen, devices_json, alive)`

**Phase 2 — Odoo Fleet view + buttons:**
- Model `erpnet.fp.proxy` (secret generated on create — admin copies into proxy `config.yaml`)
- Tree + form views, menu under ErpNet.FP
- Buttons: Update (POST `/admin/self-update`) / View Logs (GET `/admin/logs?tail=N`) / Program VAT (POST `/printers/{id}/vat-rates`) — all via stored admin_token

**Open decisions:**
- Bootstrap UX: how does proxy initially get its registry secret? Manual `config.yaml` edit (simpler) vs auto-discovery via `/admin/bootstrap-info` (zero-touch but requires registry on RFC1918 link).
- Encryption of `admin_token` storage in Odoo (security review needed before production).

### v0.5 — Odoo integration depth (~2 weeks)

**Goal:** zero-config experience for Odoo POS clients.

- Auto-discovery push to Odoo — proxy POSTs to Odoo `/web/dataset/call_kw/iot.device/auto_create` so admins don't even click the discovery wizard
- PLU sync wizards for label-printing scales — one-click "Sync products → scale memory" with the 28-prefix weight-barcode format (`28XXXXXWWWWWC`)
- Multi-tenant ErpNet.FP — one instance, many clients with separate config namespaces and isolated audit logs
- Browser-side discovery — wizard option to issue fetches from the user's browser (already in iot.box.connection_mode = `proxy` design — wire it to the wizard)

### v0.6 — Quality + tooling (~1-2 weeks)

**Goal:** confidence to release v1.0.

- pytest test suite for every driver, mocking pyserial via `pyserial.tools.testing`
- Integration tests: virtual scale + virtual fiscal printer + real Odoo POS in CI
- Hardware-in-loop CI: GitHub Actions + Raspberry Pi runner with a real DP-150 + scale on the bench
- BG admin docs — installation / config.yaml reference / common errors / per-vendor cheat-sheets
- EN technical docs — developer guide + driver-extension tutorial

### v1.0 — Stable release (~1 week)

- Signed Docker images (cosign), reproducible builds
- Stable tags: `:stable` / `:1.0` / `:latest`
- GitHub release with changelog + signed checksums
- Helm chart for Kubernetes deployments
- Public announcement: Odoo forum, LinkedIn, [`awesome-odoo`](https://github.com/odoo/awesome-odoo) PR
- Final license review (currently LGPL-3.0-or-later)
- Branded icons (placeholder green-square in v0.2.x) + Authenticode-signed Windows installer

## Module independence — Grafana embed vs ErpNet.FP monitoring stack

The Odoo Grafana embed and the ErpNet.FP-bundled monitoring stack are
**fully decoupled** — either one works without the other:

| Component | Lives in | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| `l10n_bg_erp_net_fp` "Monitoring" menu (iframe + URL config) | Odoo addon | Just an iframe — works with **any** Grafana URL the user configures |
| Bundled Prometheus + Grafana stack | `Odoo.ErpNet.FP/docker-compose.yml` | Just scrapes `odoo-erpnet-fp:8001/metrics` — works with or without an Odoo backend |

Implications:

- The Odoo embed module can point at a remote / hosted / cloud Grafana
  (a customer's existing observability stack, Grafana Cloud, etc.).
  Set Settings → POS → Embedded Grafana monitoring → URL to whatever
  Grafana you already run.
- The ErpNet.FP local stack can be browsed directly via
  `http://localhost:3001` or `https://grafana.lan.mcpworks.net`
  without ever installing the Odoo addon. This is useful for
  technicians who want a quick health dashboard at the till without
  jumping through Odoo.
- If the URL field is blank in Odoo settings, the menu still loads
  but shows a friendly "Configure Grafana URL first" message —
  no traceback.
- The dashboard JSON (`monitoring/grafana/dashboards/erpnet-fp.json`)
  is provisioned in the bundled stack but is also a plain Grafana
  export, importable into any other Grafana instance via the UI.

So you can mix and match: bundled stack only, embed only (pointing
elsewhere), both, or neither. The pieces don't share state, secrets,
or wire formats beyond standard Prometheus scrape and HTTPS iframe.

## Optional / post-1.0

- **GUI config tool** (Tauri or Electron) — for non-technical operators on Linux/Windows
- **Cluster mode** — 2+ ErpNet.FP instances behind a load balancer with shared device state
- **Cloud-managed mode** — central registry + remote config push (SaaS-style deployments)
- **Plugin SDK** — third-party driver development without forking the proxy

---

## Schedule (revised)

| Milestone | Estimate | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|
| ~~v0.2.3~~ | shipped today | — |
| v0.3 | 2 weeks (waits on hardware) | week 2 |
| v0.4 | 2 weeks | week 4 |
| v0.5 | 2 weeks | week 6 |
| v0.6 | 1-2 weeks | week 8 |
| v1.0 release | 1 week | **week 9** |

**Revised target:** **~early July 2026**, faster than original (we picked up time today with HID scanner work and end-to-end test).

---

## Open decisions (still relevant)

1. **v0.3 hardware coverage scope** — full list above, or tight subset (Borica/myPOS + label-print scales only)?
2. **Auth flavour for v0.4** — Bearer only (fast), mTLS (serious), or both?
3. **Hardware-in-loop CI for v1.0** — yes (slower but trustworthy) or no (relies on manual smoke tests)?
4. **Docs language priority** — BG first (clients in our pipeline) or EN first (community visibility)?
5. **License review** — keep LGPL-3, or split into LGPL-3 core + OPL-1 premium add-ons (cluster, cloud-managed)?

---

## Today's session deliverables (2026-05-06)

- **9 commits** on `Odoo.ErpNet.FP` (dashboard tabs, version badge, IoT compat, displays, scale drivers, last-scan endpoints, etc.)
- **8 tags** on `hid2serial` (v0.1.0 → v0.1.6, plus v0.2.0-dev)
- **5 module bumps** on `l10n_bg_erp_net_fp` (18.0.9.0.0 → **18.0.10.1.0**, mirror in v19)
- **deb package** built + tested (`hid2serial_0.1.6_all.deb`)
- **Windows installer** built via Docker (`hid2serial-0.2.0-dev-setup.exe`)
- **dev-18 deployment** — module installed + upgraded with all dependencies
- **End-to-end POS test PASSED** with real Teemi BLE scanner

### Late-evening additions (after the first POS test)

- **`/metrics` endpoint** in proxy (0.2.4) — prometheus_client wrapper with no-op fallback when the lib is missing
- **Local Prometheus + Grafana stack** in `docker-compose.yml` (0.2.4) — anonymous viewer, dark theme, 192 MB + 128 MB memory caps
- **Wildcard TLS** for `*.lan.mcpworks.net` via Traefik DNS-01 ACME (Cloudflare resolver) — same cert covers `erpnet.lan.mcpworks.net` and `grafana.lan.mcpworks.net`
- **Traefik routing precedence fix** — `priority: 100` on the grafana router so it wins over the proxy's `HostRegexp({sub:[a-z0-9-]+}.lan.mcpworks.net)` catch-all
- **Grafana iframe-embedding allowed** (0.2.5) — `GF_SECURITY_ALLOW_EMBEDDING=true` + `SameSite=none` + `Secure` cookies → drops `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- **Odoo embed module** — `l10n_bg_erp_net_fp` 18.0.10.1.0 + 19.0.10.1.0: new OWL component reads `ir.config_parameter` for URL + dashboard UID, builds kiosk-mode URL with auto-refresh, renders inside Odoo backend; new menu "Monitoring" under ErpNet.FP, restricted to `point_of_sale.group_pos_manager`
- **Documented decoupling** — see "Module independence" section above
